Personal Software Process (PSP)
	- guide to software engineering
	- plan/track/produce high quality consistently)
Measurement
	- do you know how many lines of code you write per day?
	- do you know how many errors you make per line?
Time Log
	- date, start(time), stop(time), 
	- interrupt(minutes), delta(net), 
	- activity("coding"), comments(specific)
Categories
	- Drawing/Revising Object Model
	- Writing Code
	- Compiling and Correcting Syntax Errors
	- Testing Code
	- Debugging Logic Errors
Log Summary
	- 289 source lines of code (SLOC)
	- Total Time
	- Breakdown of Time Categories
	- Coding (130 minutes)
	- Debugging (150 minutes)
Questions
	- Were the categories good?
	- What categories would have been better?
	- Have we gained any knowledge?
	- How can we use this knowledge?
Process Improvement
	1) Measure
	2) Evaluate
	3) Modify
Planning
	- You can estimate the effort required for next project
	- Accurate estimation comes with PRACTICE
	- Estimate the next and then keep log to evaluate
Personal Estimation
	- Past is best estimate of Future
	- Find some size measure of the product
		- Examples: SLOC, number of classes, number of functions
	- Determine your productivity based on size
	- Estimate size of next task
	- Calculate effort estimate
More Questions
	- How can we manage time more effectively
	- How can we manage team's time better
	- How can we use PSP to improve our team's performance
